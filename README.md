Enhanced version of less.js with added functions


This repository enhances the basic less.js and tries to bridge the difference between SCSS and LESS.
It supports the following functions at present:

1. [hextorgba(@color, alpha)](/#): converts the hex color to an rgba with alpha
2. [nth(@list, n)](/#): returns the nth value in the list passed as argument. List is passed as a comma separated string.
